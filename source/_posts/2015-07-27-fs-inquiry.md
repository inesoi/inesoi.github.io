## 分析客户询盘

1. 从询盘邮件内容分析客户意向

    + 客户（基本信息）
    + 客户所询问的问题或产品（客人所关注的问题）
    + 寻找邮件中客人提及的一些侧面信息，如客户的类型，对应的市场等等

2.  从客户的公司资料分析客户背景（公司规模，业务范围，公司性质，销售或代理的品牌，产品市场定位）

    + 会员的年份
    + 将公司名称通过搜索引擎了解一些公司情况
    + 公司地址：可通过街景搜索了解具体的位置，或辨别客人信息真实性
    + 邮箱：一般大公司会用自己公司邮箱,留意邮箱后缀，有些就是公司网站，如果是hotmail,yahoo。QQ等有即时聊天工具的邮箱，可尝试申请加客人为好友，方便更好，更快地交流
    + 公司网站：研究客户公司网站（几个主要页面以及下载客户的E-catalog, 研究并找出有价值的信息点）

## 回盘的五要素

### 标题

重要性：能让你的邮件在客户众多邮件中脱颖而出，决定客户是否会看你的邮件。

注意事项：突出卖点或邮件主题，可以是产品名称、产品系列、单价、客户名称、公司名称、邮件主要内容等等。

### 称呼
 
尽量简单口语化的称呼，无须使用如：Dear Mr.XXX之类的表达。具体称呼可以根据你和客人的熟悉程度而定，首次联系最好不要直呼其名，尽量简单口语化。比如“Hi Kelsey, Ms. Kelsey, Dear Kelsey…..etc

### 正文

投“客”所好，简洁明了。决定客户是否有兴趣回复你。

<pre>

正文和内容注意事项：

宗旨：简单明了，抓住重点，行列分明，服务第一。

* 正文无须太长，简明扼要，表达清楚即可，罗列要点时按分1、2、3点进行书写。
* 表达的内容要明确是客户所需要的，自己和公司的介绍可以用一句话带过，过多的介绍会让客人觉得有推销倾向。
* 公司实力等内容可以在后面的邮件中逐渐展示给客户。（如PDF版的公司介绍，合作过的一些知名公司或品牌的OEM加工等等）。
* 邮件正文字体、字号一致。用 12号 “Times New Roman”或者“Arial”，必要提醒时可用黑体加粗、变换字体颜色等等。
* 客人提的问题较多时，可将客人的问题复制，然后在每个问题的下方用不同的颜色回复。
* 当收到客人的询盘为中英文之外的其他语种或小语种时，可用过Google 翻译工具翻译大致了解客人需求，并用双语版(一句外语，跟一句英语)回复客人。

### 附件

附件的格式、精美度、附件内容，决定客户是否有机会能打开并看到它对其中的内容感兴趣。

1. 建议用PDF,JPEG格式作为优先选择，因为用手机查收邮件的客户越来越多。
2. 附件名称尽可能与正文提到的附件名称一致。
3. 在贴上附件的同时可以将附件插入邮件正文。

<pre>

### 附件

According to your demands, attached our xxx for your reference. Pls. check it.

### 价格

### 运费

如果客人问：

Does $90 include freight?

这种情况下另外再告诉客人含运费总共是多少钱？问客人是否有到付账号，如果有，让客人提供到付账号，只需付样品费。

对于简单的包，打样费可以少收一点。购物袋 US$50 不含快递费，加快递费收US$85 左右
收样品费的时，是否含运费一次性写清楚不要等样品好了再收，客人要多付一次手续费。

关于海运费：

<pre>
Here are two shipping options. Air transportation-- fast but cost much. The fee is nearly XX from XX to XX.
Sea transportation --cheap but should spend many days. And the cost might be XX between XX port and XX port.
 
All of the shipping would be changed for different factors.
Wish you could know it. 
</pre>

### 定金

<pre>

The freight prepaid will much cheaper than collect. 
</pre>

适当表明自己为客人努力争取过，让客人感觉你和他站在一边，但公司规则不好打破，让客人妥协，语言委婉点。不要让客人感觉有贬低我们公司或老板的意思。

<pre>
Dear Paul,

Thank you for your email.
According to our company policy, we each salesman have 3times of free sample to new customer every year. And for old customer, we could offer free samples.

It is the new beginning of 2015 working day, I’ve tried my best to apply a free sample for you. If you have no FedEx or DHL collect account or can not pay for the freight, I feel deeply regret. It’s not a big and sincere company can do so.

We are also the supplier of MaryKay(Malaysia), Dove(The Netherland), Walmart(Argentina) etc. We also charge for samples for first time. Hope you understand.

Best regards.
