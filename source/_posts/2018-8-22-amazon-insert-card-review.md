## How to Use Amazon Product Inserts for Reviews

Including physical inserts inside the packages for your products can be a very effective way for Amazon sellers to get product reviews. 

These don‚Äôt have to be super complicated. 

Basically, you want to make sure you:

1) Follow the rules.

2) Remind customers why they bought your product (highlight the benefits).

3) Actually ask them to leave a review and include instructions for doing so.

4) Keep the design simple, easy-to-read and brand-congruent.

## Don‚Äôt Break the Rules

Make sure your inserts are compliant with Amazon‚Äôs Terms of Services. A couple of reviews aren‚Äôt worth getting your seller account suspended. So be a good seller and [don‚Äôt break the rules](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200386250). 

You cannot offer a discount or any kind of incentive for a review. This is strictly against Amazon‚Äôs rules as we have mentioned in previous chapters.

And you have to encourage honest reviews ‚Äì not strictly positive reviews.

## What to Include in Product Inserts for Amazon Reviews

The card should be simple. What should you include?

### Thank you & Benefits

First, show your appreciation and thank the customer for their business. 

Then list your product‚Äôs main benefits ‚Äì what makes your product unique from the competition? This is reminding them why your product is awesome, to get them in a positive frame. Which will reduce the chances that they return the product, and increase the chances of them leaving a positive review. 

The more value they get out of your product, they more likely they will be to leave an awesome review. So  including some tips on how to get the most value out of the product can be very effective.

### Solicit Feedback

Ask them ‚ÄòAre you happy with [your product]?‚Äù and include options for Yes & No. 

_YES: Awesome! We‚Äôre glad you like it. Please leave us a review. It helps our business and also helps other customers make informed decisions. Thank you üôÇ

1.  _Sign into Amazon.com_ 
2.  _Hover over Account & Lists_
3.  _Under Your Account, click Your Orders Orders_
4.  _Find this order and click Write a Product Review_
5.  _Be honest üôÇ

_NO: We‚Äôre sorry there was a problem with the product and would love the chance to fix it. Please call us at  XXX-XXX-XXXX_

Other sellers have found success with a more indirect approach. They don‚Äôt directly ask for a review in the insert. Instead, they include instructions for claiming a 1-year warranty on their site. Customers have to input their email to claim the warranty. Once they have the email, they can ask for a review.

However, this indirect way might be considered a violation of Amazon‚Äôs Terms of Service, because you are collecting the email after selling on Amazon. Amazon explicitly says not to message its customers for marketing purposes. 

### Some Design Tips

Product inserts are usually about the size of business cards. Or a bit larger. 

Make your product cards easy to read. Don‚Äôt jam too much information on a small card. 

Put your brand logo on the card. And infuse your brand voice into it (and all communications).

## Sample Insert Card for Reviews:

Here are two examples of insert cards used to generate Amazon reviews.

### Card 1:

### Card 2:

Which of these two inserts is better? The second one certainly has a more attractive design. However, the first card provides instructions on how to leave a review. The second one also is hinting at customers only to leave positive review (the frown face is accompanied by request to call, not to leave a negative review). That might be considered manipulation.

## Using Amazon Product Inserts to Get Reviews: In Summary
