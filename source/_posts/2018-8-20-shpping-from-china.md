We are so excited to have you on board.

You are on the best way to ship from China.

The Internet makes it easier for more accurate research and understanding various options available to you and your business. The more you know, the better position you’re in to make the best possible decision.

If you are reading this, we’re going to make the assumption that you are an intelligent importer. You like to plan, prepare and think ahead. You know preparation is the mother of opportunity and prevention is better than cure.

You are looking for a close business partner.

As an international forwarding agent, CFC is serving both exporters in China and importers around the world. We’ve been working together with most of our customers for years.

We know their business. We know what they want. We give them special attention when they ask for help and anticipate issues before truly happen, though we have had a couple of problems over the years. Maybe we can’t always do everything they need, but we know how to find others to help.

We’ve seen more and more importers are seeking logistics solutions from local shipping companies like us, instead of from their supplier or freight forwarder in their countries.

_They are benefiting from their choices._

> We’d love to provide international logistics & transportation services to help more importers save time & money, so they can focus on more important work to do. Or just leverage more time to spend with their family.

That’s why we created this blog covering current industry trends, hot topics and best practices, perspectives and commentary. Whether you’re just getting familiar with supply chain issues or you’re a seasoned expert, this is your place.

In this blog we’ll share **our knowledge and practical experiences** about the international shipping industry, especially for China imports. Hope do some help to those who’re interested in international logistics and transportation.

We will be adding and updating information often. Be sure to come back to get the latest tips & tricks on China shipping. Below shows you some of our popular subjects.
