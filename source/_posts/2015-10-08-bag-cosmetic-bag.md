## Explain 3-1-1 Rule for Air Travel

See <http://traveltips.usatoday.com/explain-3-1-1-rule-air-travel-11207.html>

The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, sets and enforces the rules for air travel in the United States. Its 3-1-1 rule limits the amount of liquid a passenger can bring on in airplane in his carry-on baggage. These limits were put in place in 2006, following a foiled plot to bomb airplanes using liquids as explosives. Knowing the 3-1-1 rules can help you pack successfully for your trip.

### Rules

The 3-1-1 rule limits the amount of liquid you can bring on an airplane in your carry-on luggage. Passengers are limited to using containers no larger than __3__.4 oz. for their liquids. All containers of liquid which must be placed in a __1 qt__., transparent, plastic, sealable bag. __Each passenger__ may have only one bag for liquids. Passengers can bring on as many 3.4-oz. containers as they can fit in the quart-sized bag when it is sealed.

### Exceptions

The TSA allows a very limited number of exceptions to the 3-1-1 rule. Passengers can pack in their carry-on bags medicine, baby formula and food, breast milk, liquids such as water or orange juice for passengers with a special condition and frozen items--even if the item exceeds the 3-1-1 limits. The TSA says passengers should carry on only what will be needed during the flight but does not place a specific volume limit, saying only that these exceptions are allowed in "reasonable quantities."
